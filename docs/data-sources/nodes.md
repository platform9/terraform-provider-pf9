# pf9_nodes Data Source

The `pf9_nodes` data source offers filtering capabilities for nodes. Node IDs are essential when creating clusters, and this data source facilitates their identification.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pf9_nodes" "example" {
  # Filter is allowed on the following attributes:
  # id, name, api_responding, cluster_name, cluster_uuid, is_master, node_pool_name, node_pool_uuid, primary_ip, status
  filter = {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["foobar"]
  }
}

# Outputs id of the node whose name is "foobar"
output "foobar" {
  value = data.pf9_nodes.example.nodes[0].id
}

# Filter nodes attached to the cluster named "mycluster"
data "pf9_nodes" "example" {
  filter = {
    name = "cluster_name"
    values = [ "mycluster" ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `filter` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filter))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Placeholder for ID
- `nodes` (Attributes List) List of nodes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--nodes))

<a id="nestedatt--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the attribute on which this filter is applied
- `values` (List of String)


<a id="nestedatt--nodes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `nodes`

Read-Only:

- `api_responding` (Boolean) Indicates the API server on this node is running
- `cluster_name` (String) Name of the cluster the node belongs to
- `cluster_uuid` (String) UUID of the cluster the node belongs to
- `id` (String) UUID of the cluster
- `is_master` (Boolean) true if this node is a master of a cluster.
- `name` (String) Host name of the node
- `node_pool_name` (String) Name of the node pool, the node belongs to
- `node_pool_uuid` (String) UUID of the node pool, the node belongs to
- `primary_ip` (String) IP address of the node
- `status` (String) Status of the node. States include ok, converging, failed. These states indicate the current state of kubernetes setup on the host.
