- `id` (String) Placeholder for an ID

<a id="nestedatt--filters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filters`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the attribute on which this filter should be applied. The tags attribute is a special case where the name has to be specified as 'tags:<tag_key>'

Optional:

- `regexes` (Set of String) Set of regexes to match to the attribute value, if any of the 'regex' matches then the filter is considered to be matched
- `values` (Set of String) Set of values for the attribute, if any of the 'value' matches then the filter is considered to be matched
