## Terraform provider for PMK

Terraform(https://www.terraform.io/) has been widely regarded by the industry as a leader in the “infrastructure-as-code” space. With konform, we now enable customers to create and manage their PMK clusters with terraform, allowing them to integrate this with other components that they may already be managing with terraform, like AWS, openstack, etc.

### Getting Started

Navigate to the pf9 provider page here: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/platform9/pf9

From the versions tab, select your desired version.

Select "Use Provider" in the upper right-hand, copy/paste the provided code snippet into your main.tf.

Example:
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pf9 = {
      source = "platform9/pf9"
      version = "0.1.4"
    }
  }
}

provider "pf9" {
  # Configuration options
}
```

Run `terraform init` to initalize the plugin. 

### Usage

Konform requires you to source access credentials to the Platform9 Saas Management Plane(DU) before running terraform. Please create and source an environment file with the following fields set:

```shell
export DU_USERNAME=<Platform9 DU Username>
export DU_PASSWORD=<Password>
export DU_FQDN=<FQDN>
export DU_TENANT=<Tenant Name>
```

Cluster configuration options are then added to the terraform script and run. A sample terraform script is in [main.tf](https://github.com/platform9/konform/blob/master/main.tf) for your reference.
