# Attach and Detach Nodes

The PF9 Provider allows you to attach and detach nodes to and from your Platform9 Managed Kubernetes (PMK) clusters as master or worker nodes, giving you flexibility in managing your cluster's infrastructure.

## Finding node IDs

The node id can be obtained using the nodes data source. The nodes data source supports `filter` attribute which accepts `name` and `values` attributes.

The `name` attribute supports the following values:

- `name`
- `id`
- `primary_ip`
- `is_master`
- `api_responding`
- `cluster_name`
- `cluster_uuid`
- `node_pool_name`
- `node_pool_uuid`
- `status`

## Attaching Nodes

To attach nodes to your PMK cluster as master or worker nodes, you can use the nodes data source to filter for the nodes you want to attach and obtain their IDs programmatically. For example:


```terraform
data "pf9_nodes" "master" {
  filter = {
    name = "primary_ip"
    values = ["192.168.1.25"]
  }
}

data "pf9_nodes" "workers" {
  filter = {
    name = "primary_ip"
    values = ["192.168.1.26", "192.168.1.27", "192.168.1.28"]
  }
}

resource "pf9_cluster" "example" {
  name = "example"
  master_nodes = [
    data.pf9_nodes.master.nodes[0].id
  ]
  allow_workloads_on_master = false
  worker_nodes = data.pf9_nodes.workers.nodes[*].id
  master_ip    = data.pf9_nodes.master.nodes[0].id
  etcd_backup = {
    is_etcd_backup_enabled = true
  }
  monitoring = {
    retention_time = "7d"
  }
  tags = {
    "key1" = "value1"
  }
}
```

## Detaching Nodes

To detach nodes from your PMK cluster, simply remove their IDs from the `master_nodes` or `worker_nodes` attributes in the pf9_cluster resource configuration. For example, to detach a node with ID "2bfbc40e-1d72-4bfc-a46b-56b674862cc7" from the worker nodes:

```terraform
# Used to manage cluster resource
resource "pf9_cluster" "example" {
  name = "example"
  master_nodes = [
    "17f9b392-67bb-43b9-b0b7-3b5821f683a6",
  ]
  allow_workloads_on_master = false
  worker_nodes = [
    # "2bfbc40e-1d72-4bfc-a46b-56b674862cc7", Removed
    "bbbd1c20-3cda-405d-ae4b-d0337fffd6e1"
  ]
  # .. other attributes
}
```

## Changing Node Roles

To change the role of a node from master to worker or vice versa, simply move its ID from `master_nodes` to `worker_nodes` or vice versa in the pf9_cluster resource configuration.
